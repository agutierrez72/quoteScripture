# quoteScripture
This will be base code for memorizing scripture.
This program is designed to help user memorize quotes/scripture by filling in the missing words and phrases (similar to hangman).
Future versions of this program may be adapted to an phone application or online game.
Quotes will eventually be stored in a database along with tracking user's progress with memorization, mistakes, and desired quotes.
May also provide adaptation to search Bible/book for specific verse based on word input allowing user to select sentence/section to memorize and add to their database.
